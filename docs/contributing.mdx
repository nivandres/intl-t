## Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## Roadmap

Here are some planned features and improvements for future:

- **Translations Merging:** Support for dynamically merging and extending translation namespaces for each independent node in the tree, enabling on-demand loading and updates.
- **CLI Tooling:** Command-line utilities for managing, validating, and extracting translations.
- **Documentation Web:** A web-based documentation site for Intl-T, providing examples, guides, and API references.
- **Editor Integrations:** VSCode plugin for enhanced translation management.
- **Improved ICU Support:** More advanced ICU message format features.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Further reduce bundle size and improve runtime efficiency.
- **Plugins:** Support for third-party plugins and integrations.
- **Testing:** Add robust testing for Intl-T to ensure its reliability.
- **More frameworks:** Support for more popular frameworks and libraries, including backend frameworks.
- **Implement new features:** For example, localization for pathnames.
- **Modular and agnostic:** To ensure agnosticism, Intl-T will be a monorepo with separate modules for different environments and features (e.g., `@intl-t/next`, `@intl-t/tools`, `@intl-t/server`, etc.)
- **Intl-T Server:** Easily self-host translations with a simple API that is agnostic and compatible with the intl-t client.
- **Intl-T l10n Service:** A simple service for providing translation management to your application through intl-t API.
- **Crowdin Integration:** Integration with Crowdin for efficient translation management and dynamic loading.
