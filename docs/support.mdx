## Hello there

This translation library was originally built for my own projects, aiming to provide the best possible developer experience: high performance, ultra-lightweight, fully customizable, and with TypeScript autocomplete everywhere. It uses a translation object-based approach and offers a super flexible syntax, integrating the best features from other i18n libraries. It includes its own ICU message format, works out of the box with React and Next.js, supports static rendering, and has zero dependencies. While it's still under active development and may not yet be recommended for large-scale production projects, I am committed to improving it further. Feel free to use it, contribute, or reach out with feedback. Thank you!
