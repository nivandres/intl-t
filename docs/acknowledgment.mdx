### Acknowledgment

- [dx_over_dt's Stack Overflow answer,](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64418639/29393046) demonstrates how to override the `[Symbol.iterator]` method of a `String` object to prevent character-by-character rendering in React. This idea helped shape earlier versions of Intl-T.

- [Kent C. Dodds's blog post,](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/rendering-a-function-with-react) explores a clever way to trick React into rendering functions as children. Although, this approach is no longer supported due to `react-reconciler`. It provides historical context that eventually led to the strategy used in Intl-T.
